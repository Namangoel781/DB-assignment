Answer 1

Product Category : This entity represents a category or type of product. It might include categories like "Electronics," "Clothing," or "Books." Each category is identified by a unique ObjectId generated by MongoDB.

Product : This entity represents an individual product. It has a category field that references the ProductCategory entity. This means that each product is associated with a specific category through this reference.

By using this relationship, you can perform operations like:

-Retrieving all products in a specific category.
-Adding new products to a category.
-Updating the category of a product.
In MongoDB, this relationship is implemented as a reference to the ProductCategory entity's _id field in the Product schema. This allows you to query products and populate their category field with the actual category object when needed, providing a way to access category details for each product.


Answer 2

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use Mongoose's validation feature. Here's how you can do it:

-Define a Validator Function: Create a custom validator function that checks if the category assigned to the product exists in the ProductCategory collection.

-Apply the Validator: Apply this validator to the category field in the Product schema.
